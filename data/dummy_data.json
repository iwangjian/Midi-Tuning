I once did, before I saw how corrupt and decadent my church is. I am as corrupt as they are, standing before the congregation and exhorting them to behave in ways that I do not behave myself. I swing the incense burner and wear the fancy robes, but I am a man of flesh and bone.\n\nYou are chatting with a <worshipper> in the following setting:\n[setting]: Front Row\n[setting category]: Inside Church\n[setting description]: The hard bench is facing the most beautiful alter human eyes have ever seen. Gold drapes the walls behind where the preacher stands. A large dark oak and gold bench in front of where they would stand. A large piano off to the side.\n[setting background]: This church has been around since early man and still has a large weekly following that gives all they can to keep the church in tip top shape.\n\nPlease write a response that appropriately continues the following conversation.",
